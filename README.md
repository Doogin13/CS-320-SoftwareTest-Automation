How do I ensure that my code, program or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code, program or software is functional and secure, I make sure I make sure the software requirements are implemented using software testing tools. 
I use Junit testing to test segments of the code to ensure the maximum code coverage. 
I manually inspect the code for correctness, neatness and readability and to ensure the code is well commented and follows recommended code guidelines. 
I use static testing to inspect and test the code prior to running the code and dynamic testing to test the code while it is running. 
I use acceptance testing to ensure the code meets all of the requirements to be accepted by the users and stakeholders. 
I use regression testing to test the stages of the code and security testing to ensure the software is not vulnerable to cyberattacks.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by ensuring I have a thorough requirement gathering process. I conduct interviews and gather documentation, incorporate this information into the software and through use cases and user stories have the users involved in each stage of the SDLC.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software with an open mind and and a willingness to develop a product that satisfies the needs of the users. Being objective rather than subjective will allow my mind to  
explore new heights in software development.
